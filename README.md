# VS Code Issue Triage Extension

This is a chromium extension to help with triaging GitHub issues. It was
originally developed for our work in the
[microsoft/vscode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) repo, but it can be used
on any GitHub repo.

## Install

You can pull the latest release from the
[releases page](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-github-triage-extension/releases)
and unzip it. Then, navigate to your extension configuration page
(edge://extensions/, for instance), and make sure "Developer Mode" is enabled.
There should be an option to "Load Unpacked". Select this, then choose the
folder you unpacked earlier.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Press Cmd+Shift+L to trigger the extension. This can be customized on your
browser's extension configuration page under "Keyboard Shortcuts". (This was
previously Cmd+Shift+P but changed due to conflict with Codepsaces)

Press enter in search to accept first result. Tab/ArrowKeys to move around in
results. Enter/Space to accept results. Cmd with the action to multi-select.

## Configuration

Use the `Settings` link at bottom of the popup to view and edit the JSON
representation of your commands. The supported file takes the form (as
typescript):

```ts
type Settings = { [repo: string]: Category[] };
type Category = { category: string; description: string; items: Shortcut[] };
type Shortcut = {
	title: string;
	color?: string;
	type: "label" | "comment" | "assign" | "milestone";
	value: string;
};
```

For instance:

```json
{
	"microsoft/vscode": [
		{
			"category": "Verification",
			"description": "Apply common verification labels",
			"items": [
				{
					"color": "rgb(0, 152, 0)",
					"title": "verified",
					"type": "label",
					"value": "verified"
				},
				{
					"color": "rgb(247, 198, 199)",
					"title": "verification-found",
					"type": "label",
					"value": "verification-found"
				}
			]
		},
		{
			"category": "Won't Fix",
			"description": "Trigger bot to close issue and add a comment explaining why",
			"items": [
				{
					"color": "rgb(226, 161, 194)",
					"title": "*as-designed",
					"type": "label",
					"value": "*as-designed"
				}
			]
		}
	]
}
```
